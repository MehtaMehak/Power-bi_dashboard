 # Power BI Repository

 # About

This repository is a collection of Power BI projects I have worked on to showcase my skills and expertise in data visualization, business intelligence, and analytical reporting. Power BI is a powerful data analytics and visualization tool that has become an increasingly important part of the modern data ecosystem.

The projects in this repository demonstrate my ability to:

- Connect to a variety of data sources, including databases, spreadsheets, and cloud-based services.

- Transform and clean data using Power Query.

- Create interactive and visually appealing reports and dashboards.

- Implement advanced analytical features such as measures, calculated columns, and DAX calculations

By exploring these Power BI projects, you'll get a glimpse into my problem-solving abilities attention to detail, and commitment to delivering impactful data insights. I've worked on a diverse range of topics, from sales and marketing analytics to HR performance -monitoring, forecasting and financial reporting.
